# Face Mesh using Python

## Face Mesh:
MediaPipe Face Mesh is a face geometry solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D surface geometry, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor.

## Requirements:
Inorder for this project to run, you need to install the following libraries:
- OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
- Mediapipe (pip install mediapipe)

## Options:
You can detect a face mesh on both of the following options:
- Static Images imported to the project
- Real-time video straight from the web-cam

## Uses:
FaceMesh is mostly used in AR Technology. For instance, different face editing apps use the same feature.
